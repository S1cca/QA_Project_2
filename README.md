Created By Wei Yao

### Brief

 > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This a web application that consist four services that work together to provide full functionality, randomly generates a DFO character with basic information, such as Class, Gender, Subclass and Birth Place.

### Objectives

* Service 1 will render templates and communicate with the other three services
* Services 2 and 3 will both generate random objects
* Service 4 will also create an object but one that is based on the objects generated by service 2 and 3

### Trello

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have used Treloo Board to manage and organise my workflow, so I would be able to follow up all requirements of this project and avoid and missing tasks, and what to do next once a task was completed, as well as tracking my overall progress.
